**Support Vector Rgression**
    - Dataset - Position_Salaries.csv

    - Feature scaling done to both X and y as output - salary is high value compared to feature
    - Train/Test Split not done as small dataset
    - Non linear model, kernel - "rbf" 
    - To get the result back in original scale, do Inverse Transform.
    - predict for a new data, and the whole dataset.
    

**Decision Tree Rgression**
    - Dataset - Position_Salaries.csv

    - No need to do Feature Scaling 
    - scikit learn DecisionTreeRegressor model
    - predict for a new data, and the whole dataset.
